## What is Keras?

## Why use Keras?

## What's the difference?

## What problems do neural nets work best with?

### Feature Extraction

### Unstructured data

### When you don't need interpretation

## What does a neural network look like?

## Weight tuning

## Get your hands dirty!

```
# load libraries
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
# instantiate model
model = Sequential()
# here you can add your hidden layer
model.add(Dense(4, input_shape=(2,), activation="relu"))
# one neuron output!
model.add(Dense(1))
model.summary()
```
