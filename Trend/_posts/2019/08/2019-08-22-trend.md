## Basic topics

### Anchors - ^ and $

```
^The        matches any string that starts with The -> Try it!
end$        matches a string that ends with end
^The end$   exact string match (starts and ends with The end)
roar        matches any string that has the text roar in it
```

### Quantifiers - \*+? and {}
```
abc*        matches a string that has ab followed by zero or more c -> Try it!
abc+        matches a string that has ab followed by one or more c
abc?        matches a string that has ab followed by zero or one c
abc{2}      matches a string that has ab followed by 2 c
abc{2,}     matches a string that has ab followed by 2 or more c
abc{2,5}    matches a string that has ab followed by 2 up to 5 c
a(bc)*      matches a string that has a followed by zero or more copies of the sequence bc
a(bc){2,5}  matches a string that has a followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence bc
```

### OR operator - | or []
```
a(b|c)     matches a string that has a followed by b or c -> Try it!
a[bc]      same as previous
```

### Character classes - \\d \\w \\s and .

```
\d         matches a single character that is a digit -> Try it!
\w         matches a word character (alphanumeric character plus underscore) -> Try it!
\s         matches a whitespace character (includes tabs and line breaks)
.          matches any character -> Try it!
```

```
\D         matches a single non-digit character -> Try it!
```

```
\$\d       matches a string that has a $ before one digit -> Try it!
```
### Flags

## Intermediate topics

### Grouping and capturing - ()
```
a(bc)           parentheses create a capturing group with value bc -> Try it!
a(?:bc)*        using ?: we disable the capturing group -> Try it!
a(?<foo>bc)     using ?<foo> we put a name to the group -> Try it!
```

### Bracket expressions - []

```
[abc]            matches a string that has either an a or a b or a c -> is the same as a|b|c -> Try it!
[a-c]            same as previous
[a-fA-F0-9]      a string that represents a single hexadecimal digit, case insensitively -> Try it!
[0-9]%           a string that has a character from 0 to 9 before a % sign
[^a-zA-Z]        a string that has not a letter from a to z or from A to Z.
In this case the ^ is used as negation of the expression -> Try it!
```
### Greedy and Lazy match
```
<.+?>            matches any character one or more times included
inside < and >, expanding as needed -> Try it!

```

```
<[^<>]+>         matches any character except < or > one or more times included inside < and > -> Try it!
```
## Advanced topics
### Boundaries - \\b and \\B
```
\babc\b          performs a "whole words only" search -> Try it!
```

```
\Babc\B          matches only if the pattern is fully surrounded by word characters -> Try it!
```
### Back-references - \\1
```
([abc])\1              using \1 it matches the same text that was matched by the first capturing group -> Try it!
([abc])([de])\2\1      we can use \2 (\3, \4, etc.) to identify the same text that was
 matched by the second (third, fourth, etc.) capturing group -> Try it!
(?<foo>[abc])\k<foo>   we put the name foo to the group and we reference it later (\k<foo>).
The result is the same of the first regex -> Try it!
```

### Look-ahead and Look-behind - (?=) and (?<=)
```
d(?=r)       matches a d only if is followed by r, but r will not be part of the overall regex match -> Try it!
(?<=r)d      matches a d only if is preceded by an r, but r will not be part of the overall regex match -> Try it!
```

```
d(?!r)       matches a d only if is not followed by r, but r will not be part of the overall regex match -> Try it!
(?<!r)d      matches a d only if is not preceded by an r, but r will not be part of the overall regex match -> Try it!
```
